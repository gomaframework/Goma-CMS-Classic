Goma CMS
========

This is a Web Content Managment System, which allows you to create fast and easy websites.

At the moment we're developing version 2.0 of Goma, so please be patient. It's done, when it's done.

### Installation of Goma

Please follow the [Installation guide](https://confluence.goma-cms.org/display/GOMA/Installation+Guide) on our confluence space.

### Troubleshooting
Notice for RedHat-related OS:

Goma needs the package php-xml from the OS Repos (e.g. Fedora or Mandriva Main).

For IIS, you need the module [URL Rewrite](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite), otherwise Goma won't work.

More Troubleshooting is also on our [Confluence Troubleshooting-Page](https://confluence.goma-cms.org/display/GOMA/Troubleshooting)
